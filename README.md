# Detecting-textual-propaganda-using-machine-learning

The crux of this project is to use Machine Learning tools/algorithms and analyze the data collected from online platforms and differentiate them between Propagandist text from Non-Propagandist.

# Fake-News-App
Fake news prediction using **Machine Learning algorithms and Flask Framework**.
Enter your text or generate a random one from our dataset to try it.
The text is first preprocessed and transformed as a vector. Then, the transformed vector is feeded to the trained model to be classified as fake or not fake.
